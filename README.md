# Kill the Warrior Orc
### a generic roguelike written in JavaScript with ROT.js
This was written as my first RL game in preparation for [7drl](http://7drl.org).  It's very generic, and most of it was created following [this amazing tutorial](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/), though I did freshen a few things up by using webpack to bundle my modules rather than linking multiple JS files in the html.

[you can play the game here](http://codyloyd.com/jsrl)

## Game Keybindings:
- movement: arrow-keys, numpad, or vi-keys.
- up or down stairs: `<` or `>`
- pick up item: `,`
- view inventory: `i`
- eat: `e` (including potions)
- wield: `w`
- wear: `W`
- throw: `t` (can only throw in 4 directions--no diagonals)

## to run locally:
run `npm install`

run `npm start`
